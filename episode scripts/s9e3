Fake Jim: Morning, Dwight
Dwight: Who are you?
Fake Jim: Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight.
Dwight: You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
Fake Jim: You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race.
Dwight: Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
Fake Jim: Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me.
Voicemail: Please enter your password.
Voicemail: You have one new message.
Dwight: How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
Fake Jim: Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work.
Dwight: You don't work here! You're not Jim!
Pam: Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Gricoâ€™s at 7:30.
Fake Jim: Oh great, can't wait. [Kisses Pam]

Pam: Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.

Dwight: I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
[Dwight shows fake Jim of the Halpert family portrait but notices that Jim and the kids have been replaced with fake Jim and Asian kids]
Dwight: Oh myâ€”! Oh dâ€”! Oh, how didâ€”? [gasps] Huhhhhh!

Erin: Heyyy! Study buddies!
Darryl: Oh, ok.
Erin: Getting things done. Awesome!
Darryl: It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!

Darryl: Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Letâ€™s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.

Erin:
