Gabe: Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
Dwight: Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why donâ€™t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.

Gabe: I remember when people thought biceps were all that. Theyâ€™d flex them all night at the discotheque.
Dwight: Oh, I bet you think itâ€™s all about core, huh?
Gabe: Yeah.
Dwight: Oh, please.
Gabe: Coreâ€™s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One â€“ lengthen. Two â€“ elongate.
Jim: Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Whoâ€™s the strongest? Well, thereâ€™s only one way to solve that â€“ flat curl contest.

Jim: All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Dwight: Feast on this, Lewis.
Gabe: I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Jim: Come on, Gabe, you canâ€™t handle his hamstrings. Youâ€™re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Gabe: Speed set. One. Two.
Jim: Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Dwight: Oh, thank you.
Jim: Youâ€™re welcome.
Gabe: Five. Six.
Jim: Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
All: Eight, nine, ten.
Gabe: We got it?

Dwight: Very funny Jim.
Gabe: Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Robert: Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over] 
Jim: All right, easy there, grandpa.
Dwight: I donâ€™t need your help.
Jim: Okay. You donâ€™t need my help?
Dwight: Here, hereâ€¦ Justâ€¦

Andy: Morning.
Erin: Hey.
Andy: Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgotâ€¦ these.
Erin: Oh.
Andy: You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Erin: Andy, if youâ€™re gonna hang out for a while, uhâ€¦
Andy: Whatâ€™s this?
Erin: This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Andy: Is this Robertâ€™s attempt to embarrass me?
Erin: No, of course not. Itâ€™s just â€“ I think itâ€™s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, itâ€™s like, where does it end? So justâ€¦ [puts visitors tag on Andy]

Andy: Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, theyâ€™re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told itâ€™s a little much? â€¦Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because thatâ€™s what it feels like.

Jim: All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Dwight: Good, we have a deal?
Jim: Thanks Janet.
Dwight: Thanks so much Earl.
Jim: Wow, simultaneous sale.
Dwight: And they said it couldnâ€™t be done. Boom!
Jim: Screw â€˜em.
Andy: Lot going on guys. Whatâ€™s happening?
Jim: Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Andy: That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. Itâ€™s like a festival of poo.
Jim: Hey, hey, come on, language.
Dwight: Yeah, and weâ€™re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Jim: In the fridge.
Dwight: No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
Jim: Sorry, man, I canâ€™t focus on zingers. Thereâ€™s too many potential clients.
Stanley: You two better watch yourselves.
Phyllis: Yeah, the Syracuse branch canâ€™t be happy youâ€™re taking New York clients.
Robert: Shhâ€¦ shhâ€¦ [vomits in trash can]
Jim: Robert?
Oscar: Why did Binghamton close?
Robert: Can everyone just, pleaseâ€¦ I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and â€“ how should I say this â€“ Columbian whites. What â€“ what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
Kevin: The branch closed. Forever.

Robert: Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, Iâ€™m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.

Nellie: I got your voicemail. From â€“ from last night.
Robert: Wonderful.
Nellie: And the answerâ€¦ is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Robert: Pam, whenâ€™s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldnâ€™t hold the memories in?
Pam: Oh, it was this summer â€“
Robert: Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
Pam: Um, I am a little busy.
Robert: Yes, â€˜course. Why donâ€™t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
Pam: Yeah, I can make you a list.
Robert: Letâ€™s do it now. Whatâ€™s number one?
Pam: Why donâ€™t I help you now?
Robert: There we go.
Pam: Okay.

[Andy cooking food by reception, Harry walks in]
Harry: Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?
Erin: Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
Dwight: And you areâ€¦
Harry: Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse. 
[shocked look from Jim]
Harry: What the hellâ€™s all this?
Andy: Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
Harry: You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which oneâ€™s that guy?

Jim: The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Dwight: Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to â€“ how do I put this â€“ steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Jim: Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]

Dwight: [pointing at Toby] There he is. Thatâ€™s Lloyd.
Toby: Me?
Creed: Yeah, you.

Harry: Where do you get off crossing state lines?
Toby: Now, weâ€™re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.

Toby:
