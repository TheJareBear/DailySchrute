Jim: Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
Pam: Hey guys!
All: Hey.
Pam: [laughing] Hi.
Andy: Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Phyllis: Are you glad to be back?
Pam: Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
Stanley: You still had eight weeks more than we did.
Pam: [laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation.
Angela: Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
Dwight: What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Angela: I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Pam: What?!
Kelly: Damn girl! Your body!
Oscar: Angela, you look amazing.
Angela: Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
Group: [murmurs of delight as people shuffle toward the treats]
Pam: Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
Kevin: Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.
Pam: Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
Angela: I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
Pam: When did you find time to do all this?
Angela: Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
Pam: Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
Angela: I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
Pam: So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
Jim: Nope. It's over.
Pam: ...we wanted to say thank you-
Jim: Nope. OK.

Andy: Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
Dwight: What?
Andy: I think you're going to like it.
Dwight: You can't tantalize me.
Andy: Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
Dwight: OK. [looks at watch and leaves]
Andy: That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
Dwight: If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
Andy: No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
Dwight: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

Dwight:
