Oscar: [to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?

Oscar: I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?

Andy: Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
White: Or we can hope for a holiday rally?
Andy: White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.

Pam: Andy's family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
Jim: And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
Pam: The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
Jim: Competent.
Pam: Right?

Andy: Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.

Oscar: Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
Kevin: That's beautiful. No, I totally get that.
Oscar: Can you do this, Kevin?
Kevin: I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
Oscar: I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-

Pam: [On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
Creed: Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show.
Pam: Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
Dwight: I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.

Dwight:
