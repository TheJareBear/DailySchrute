Dwight: [as elevator door closes] Hold it!
Creed: [notices something new about Dwight] New glasses.

Erin: Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Dwight: I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
Pam: Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
Dwight: I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.

Dwight: My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.

Jim: My condolences.
Dwight: Keep them.
Jim: OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
Dwight: In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil. 
Erin: [after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
Phyllis: It looks pretty black.
Kevin: [after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
Oscar: [while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Dwight: Excuse me?
Oscar: I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session... 
Dwight: OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]

Oscar: I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.

Jim: [as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Dwight: I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
Jim: OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Dwight: I miss her so much.
Jim: OK.
Dwight: You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]

Mose: [playing guitar and singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning'] Zeke's here.
Dwight: Zeke.
Zeke: Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'.
Mose: 'Hi' to Mom.
Dwight: Are you going?
Mose: Will there be ghosts there?
Dwight: [simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Zeke: You get in the sidecar.
Dwight: Get... 

Dwight: [at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
Oscar: You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
Dwight: [smirking] Oh, yeah.
Oscar: [as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
Dwight: Jeb, my brother.
Oscar: You have a brother?
Dwight: Uh-huh.
Jeb: I didn't really see a better parking spot. [drives into the dug grave] Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental. [Dwight approaches and hugs him] You wanna go in? [both attempt to put the other in the dug grave]

Erin: [upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
Todd Packer: Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
Clark: [to Pam] Who's this guy?
Pam: â€¦ bad.
Todd Packer: Hi, all.
Phyllis: Why are you here, Todd?
Todd Packer: OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.
Kevin: Packer, we accept. [others disagree]
Todd Packer: Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff.  OK. Uh, where to begin. [to Pam] Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. [to Phyllis] Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, [points to Clark] this kid in a few years.
Pam: Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
Todd Packer: Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apologyâ€™s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.
Pam: I think it's called 'Nibbles'.
Todd Packer: Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.
Pam: Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.

German Minister: We are here today to join this woman and the ground. Man is born of woman and his life is full of turmoil. 
Jeb: [gathers and tastes soil] Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here.
Dwight: Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
Jeb: Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all.
Dwight: Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
Jeb: It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow.
Dwight: Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Jeb: Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any.
German Minister: Would the family care to say something?
Dwight: You had black hair and then gray hair.
Zeke:
THIS IS THE END OF THE SCRIPT
