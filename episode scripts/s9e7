Andy: [on computer screen] Ah, what else? Iâ€™ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?
Everyone: Whoa!
Pam: Andy.
Andy: That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
Phyllis: Donâ€™t you have any sunblock?
Andy: No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  Theyâ€™re like two flaming meatballs in my skull.

Erin: Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his familyâ€™s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.

Andy: [on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. Thatâ€™s what I call the sun now.
Darryl: Andy, itâ€™s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
Andy: What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
Erin: Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
Andy: Yeah, it was. Thatâ€™s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
Everyone: Oh!
Andy: Ah! Thatâ€™s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]

Darryl: Heâ€™s been sailing for two days.

Andy: [on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
Erin: [laughing] Yeah.
Andy: No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean]
Erin: Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.

Dwight: [answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
David: [on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
Dwight: And you didnâ€™t call Jim - that seems significant.
Jim: Hi, David.
David: Jim, good! You should hear this too.
Dwight: No, he shouldnâ€™t.
Jim: [taking away Dwightâ€™s handset] Go ahead David, Iâ€™m listening.
Dwight: Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™d put you.
David: Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. Theyâ€™ve apparently just dropped the supplier theyâ€™ve been with for the last ten years. .
Dwight: The White Pages.

Dwight:
THIS IS THE END OF THE SCRIPT
