Dwight: Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
Ryan: Are you holding this chair?
Dwight: Yes.
Ryan: â€˜cause I feel like Iâ€™m gonna fall off.
Dwight: Yes. Yes.
Ryan: Iâ€™m not wearing the right shoes for this.
Dwight: We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Erin: Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.

Erin: Hey, my nameâ€™s Tabitha. Iâ€™m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. Itâ€™s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and itâ€™s working. Thereâ€™s already people camped out behind me.

Nellie: Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think Iâ€™m this patrician goddess. But hereâ€™s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than â€¦ whatâ€™s lower than dirt?
Dwight: Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Nellie: Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didnâ€™t even get a callback.
Jim: Which Spice Girl?
Nellie: The black one. I never stood a chance.
Jim: Okay.
Nellie: Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
Dwight: Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
Todd Packer: Yep
Dwight: Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing â€“ bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. Youâ€™re gonna love â€˜em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a worldâ€™s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
Ryan: When people see this presentation, theyâ€™re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
Dwight: Okay.
Jim: Come on, man.
Cathy: Seriously disgusting.
Dwight: Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Cathy: Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.
Dwight: Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.

Todd Packer: Uhâ€¦
Nellie: Uhâ€¦ that is excellent.
Todd Packer: I donâ€™t see what that gets us, but Iâ€™m a team player.
Dwight: Perfect casting, right?

Todd Packer: Schruteâ€™s out to get me. But Iâ€™m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.

Nellie: I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
Dwight: Speaking of pimples, letâ€™s release the BLOGGERS!

Andy: Morning, everyone.
Kevin: Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
Andy: Donâ€™t care. Tell me later.
Kevin: Listen, itâ€™s important. Youâ€™ve gotta hear this.
Andy: What do you got?
Kelly: Oh, my god!
Phyllis: Do you have a black eye?
Andy: Yes, I do. Phyllis.
Kevin: I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
Andy: What?
Kevin: Itâ€™s not a kid on a bike. Itâ€™s a man in a car.
Darryl: Andy, who punched you?
Meredith: Hey, I was on the can. Whatâ€™s this about a black guy in the office?
Angela: Black eye, Meredith.
Kelly: Will someone please explain whatâ€™s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, itâ€™s like my life is buffering.
Andy: Hereâ€™s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pamâ€¦
Pam: Thatâ€™s true.
Andy: They had, uhâ€¦ weapons.
Pam: Weapons.
Andy: I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
Pam: But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Andy: Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
Pam: Thank goodness he was there.
Oscar: Good job Andy.
Kevin: Yeah [all murmuring]
Andy: I didnâ€™t do anything any of you wouldnâ€™t have done.

Dwight: Open the gates! Thereâ€™s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. Thereâ€™s plenty for everyone!
Man: Quit it.
Dwight: Thereâ€™s plenty. Donâ€™t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Erin: I was ahead of you!
Dwight: Okay, okay. Hey, hey. Itâ€™s gonna be fine. Itâ€™s gonna be fine. Thereâ€™s plenty of Pyramids.
Erin: Come on. I was in line before you.

Cathy: So youâ€™re a blogger right?
Blogger: Yeah. Blogger.
Cathy: God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. Iâ€™m trying to be a good girl for once.

Erin: Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I donâ€™t want to leave yet. I havenâ€™t had so much fun since seeingâ€¦ zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.

Oscar: How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
Andy: No.
Angela: Yes.
Andy: No, no, no, no, no, we donâ€™t need to call the police. Theyâ€™ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyoneâ€™s business, right, Pam?
Pam: Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
Andy: And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
Angela: Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Andy: Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
Pam: 1-8-5-0-5.
Darryl: Guys, guys. Thatâ€™s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
Phyllis: Look, I donâ€™t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
Angela: Yes.
Andy: Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is whyâ€¦ Toby is giving us self defense training.
Toby: Me?
Andy: Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
Toby: Yeah, um... I canâ€™t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, Iâ€™ll go put on my cup.
Andy: Great.

Nellie: Yes!
Blogger: Okay.
Nellie: I wasnâ€™t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
Jim: [on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Blogger: Look at that guy. Heâ€™s got his Sabre phone on, and heâ€™s not even using it.
Blogger 2: This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.
Jim: Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
Nellie: Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
Dwight: Oh, no, no, no. Itâ€™s good. Itâ€™s really -- on the Internet, itâ€™s a really -- thatâ€™s a really good, good, thing.

Dwight: Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
Jim: Iâ€™m very sorry.
Nellie:
THIS IS THE END OF THE SCRIPT
